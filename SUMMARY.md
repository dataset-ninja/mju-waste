**MJU-Waste Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and monocular depth estimation tasks. It is used in the waste recycling industry. 

The dataset consists of 4950 images with 5026 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*waste*).

Images in the MJU-Waste dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 16 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (2970 images), *test* (1484 images), and *val* (496 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control, China, College of Mathematics and Computer Science, China, NetDragon Inc., China, and School of Electronic and Information Engineering, China.
